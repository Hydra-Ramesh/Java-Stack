The Process of Storing and managing the data for long time is called "Persistency".
To achive Persistency We use 1) File Operations and 2) Database
Persistance Store- It is a place or store where will be saved and managed for a long time.
   1) File OPerations[Storing it is HDD]=> java.io.*
   2) Database[Storing it in the form of Table]=> java.sql.*
Persistance Data- The data of Persistance Store is called Persistance Data.
Ex. File Info, DB Tables and their records.
Persistance Operation- The Operation which are performed on Persistance Data. Such as Inderting the Data, Updating data. Manipulating Data, retriving data.
Persistance Logic- The Logic which is written to perform Persistance operation is called as Persistence logic.
Ex. 1) IO Streams (Serialization, DeSerialization)
    2) JDBC Code(Technology name is JDBC API)
    3) Hibernate COde
    4) Spring JDBC
    5) Spring ORM
    6) Spring DataJPA
Persistance Framework or Persistance Technology- The Technology or Framework through which we write persistance logic is called Persistence Technology or Framework.
Ex. 1) JDBC[Technology]
    2) Hibernate[Framework/Tool]
    3) Spring JDBC/SpringORM/SpringDataJpa[Framework]
