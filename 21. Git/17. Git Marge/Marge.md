After chacking the all branch of remote repo or if we have multiple branch then we can merge.
Then we have to go main branch for marging.
The command is (git marge brach name(except main branch
))
Sometime we have to pull the main branch at first.
the command is (git pull origin main)
Then we can push the code by (git push origin main)
