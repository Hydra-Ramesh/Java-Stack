### History of Git

**Before Git**:
- Before Git, developers primarily used Centralized Version Control Systems (CVCS) like CVS (Concurrent Versions System) and SVN (Apache Subversion).
- These systems had a central server where the repository was stored, and developers would check out and commit changes to this central server.
- Despite their popularity, CVCS had several drawbacks:
  - Single point of failure: If the central server went down, no one could commit changes or collaborate.
  - Limited offline capabilities: Developers needed a network connection to interact with the central server.
  - Performance bottlenecks: All operations depended on the central server, which could become a bottleneck.

**Development of Git**:
- Git was created by Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux, in 2005.
- The development of Git was motivated by the need for a version control system that could handle the scale and distributed nature of the Linux kernel development.
- Before Git, the Linux kernel project used BitKeeper, a DVCS. However, the relationship between the Linux kernel community and BitKeeper's company soured, leading to the need for a new tool.

**Key Features and Design of Git**:
- **Distributed Version Control**: Every developer has a complete copy of the repository, including the full history, on their local machine. This enables offline work and eliminates the single point of failure.
- **Speed and Efficiency**: Git is designed to be fast. Local operations are quick because they do not require network access.
- **Branching and Merging**: Git provides powerful branching and merging capabilities, allowing developers to experiment with different ideas and integrate them seamlessly.
- **Data Integrity**: Git uses SHA-1 hashes to ensure the integrity of every file and commit, preventing corruption and ensuring that history cannot be changed without detection.
- **Staging Area**: Git introduced the concept of a staging area (or index), which allows developers to prepare commits by selecting changes to include.

**Milestones in Git's History**:
- **2005**: Git is created by Linus Torvalds in April. The first version (0.01) is released in a few days.
- **2005**: Junio Hamano takes over as the maintainer of Git in July.
- **2005**: Git 1.0 is released in December, marking the software as stable and ready for production use.
- **2008**: GitHub is launched, providing a web-based hosting service for Git repositories. This significantly boosts Git's popularity.
- **2010**: Git 1.7.0 is released, bringing significant improvements and new features.
- **2014**: Microsoft announces support for Git in Visual Studio and on their Team Foundation Server.
- **2015**: Git 2.5.0 is released, introducing new features and performance enhancements.
- **2020**: Git 2.28.0 is released, adding support for configurable default branch names, reflecting a shift away from "master" to more inclusive terminology.

### Before Git: Other Version Control Systems

**1. CVS (Concurrent Versions System)**:
- Developed in the late 1980s.
- One of the first popular CVCS.
- Allowed multiple developers to collaborate, but had limitations in handling complex branching and merging.

**2. RCS (Revision Control System)**:
- Developed in the early 1980s.
- A local version control system used for individual files.
- Stored differences between file versions, but was not designed for team collaboration.

**3. SVN (Apache Subversion)**:
- Developed as an improvement over CVS in 2000.
- Addressed many of CVS's shortcomings, such as atomic commits and better handling of binary files.
- Became a popular CVCS and was widely adopted in the early 2000s.

**4. BitKeeper**:
- A distributed version control system used by the Linux kernel project before Git.
- Proprietary software, which led to conflicts with the open-source community.
- Its discontinuation for the Linux kernel project was a significant factor in the creation of Git.
