In Git, "forking" is the process of creating a personal copy of someone else's repository, mainly on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket. This allows you to experiment with changes without affecting the original project.

### Steps to Fork a Repository

1. **Fork the Repository**:
   - On GitHub, go to the repository you want to fork.
   - Click the "Fork" button at the top right corner.
   - This creates a copy under your GitHub account.

2. **Clone Your Fork**:
   - Clone the repository to your local machine:
     ```sh
     git clone https://github.com/your-username/repo-name.git
     ```

3. **Set Upstream Remote**:
   - Add the original repository as an upstream remote to keep your fork updated:
     ```sh
     cd repo-name
     git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-owner/repo-name.git
     ```

4. **Sync with Upstream**:
   - Fetch and merge changes from the upstream repository to keep your fork in sync:
     ```sh
     git fetch upstream
     git merge upstream/main
     ```

5. **Push Changes to Your Fork**:
   - Make changes and push them to your fork:
     ```sh
     git add .
     git commit -m "Description of changes"
     git push origin main
     ```

6. **Create a Pull Request**:
   - On GitHub, navigate to your fork and click "New pull request" to propose changes to the original repository.

### Summary

Forking allows you to independently develop features and fix bugs without affecting the original project. Once your changes are ready, you can propose them for inclusion in the original repository via a pull request.
